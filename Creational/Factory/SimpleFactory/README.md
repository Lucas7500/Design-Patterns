The Simple Factory Pattern is a creational design pattern that encapsulates the logic of object creation in a single place. 
Instead of directly instantiating objects, a factory class decides which specific object to create based on input parameters.

Reminder: Simple Factory is not considered an official Design Pattern in the "Gang of Four" book, but it is widely used in software development for its simplicity and effectiveness.
