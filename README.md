# Design Patterns Catalog

This repository provides categorized examples and explanations of the most widely used **Design Patterns** in software engineering. The patterns are organized into three main categories:

---

## Creational Patterns

These patterns are concerned with the way objects are created. They help make a system independent of how its objects are created, composed, and represented.

- [x] Singleton  
- [x] Simple Factory (Unofficial)  
- [x] Factory Method  
- [x] Abstract Factory  
- [x] Builder  
- [x] Prototype  

---

## Structural Patterns

Structural patterns deal with the composition of classes and objects. They help ensure that if one part of a system changes, the entire system doesn't need to do the same.

- [x] Adapter  
- [x] Bridge  
- [ ] Composite  
- [x] Decorator  
- [x] Facade  
- [ ] Flyweight  
- [x] Proxy

## Behavioral Patterns

Behavioral patterns are concerned with algorithms and the assignment of responsibilities between objects. They help manage communication between objects.


- [ ] Chain of Responsibility  
- [ ] Command  
- [ ] Interpreter  
- [x] Iterator  
- [ ] Mediator  
- [ ] Memento  
- [x] Observer  
- [x] State  
- [x] Strategy  
- [x] Template Method  
- [ ] Visitor
